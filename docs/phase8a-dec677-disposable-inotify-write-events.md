# DEC-677 — Disposable Linux inotify write-and-restore witness

**DRAFT / NEVER MERGE · SOURCE ONLY · No annual authorization.**

This prototype complements DEC-674 draft #845's digest-blindness counterexample. It uses a real Linux inotify watch on **one newly generated public synthetic file under fixed /tmp**. No protected annual checkout, historical artifact, GitHub workflow or broker input is accepted.

## What it demonstrates

The opt-in negative case creates a watch **before** two real flushed-and-fsynced writes (original bytes -> different public bytes -> original bytes). Initial and final bytes and SHA-256 match, but the kernel-generated event queue contains write/close-write events. The collector requires a bounded well-formed event buffer, the exact synthetic watch descriptor, no IN_Q_OVERFLOW, no IN_IGNORED / IN_DELETE_SELF / IN_MOVE_SELF, and observes two or more write-related events for the deliberate negative control. The verdict is BLOCKED, exit 2, **despite an identical final checksum**. A clean disposable case with no writes produces only LOCAL_DISPOSABLE_WITNESS_UNVERIFIED, exit 3, never PASS.

A malformed/truncated event, wrong watch descriptor, event queue overflow, watcher invalidation, missing monitor prerequisites, changed final bytes or any observed write causes BLOCKED. No raw inode paths, host credentials or sensitive data appear in JSON. Every result has can_authorize_dispatch=false and independent_os_proof_verified=false.

Default CLI is inert BLOCKED exit 2:

    python -B scripts/dec677_disposable_inotify_events.py

Explicit synthetic Linux cases:

    python -B scripts/dec677_disposable_inotify_events.py --execute-disposable-control
    python -B scripts/dec677_disposable_inotify_events.py --execute-reverted-write-negative

The **18 source-defined tests** passed in an author-local Linux run; default tests passed with the two real inotify demonstrations skipped. With DEC677_EXECUTE_INOTIFY_TEST=1 the full 18 tests passed, including both kernel cases. These are opt-in OS experiments, intentionally not normal CI acceptance.

## Important limitations

**inotify is event observation, NOT OS write prevention.** It does not stop a privileged writer, make a read-only checkout, authenticate the observer process, protect against queue overflow or missed windows between installing/removing watches, cover arbitrary writable inode aliases, handle all mount namespaces or guarantee audit completeness after a malicious process tampers with the collector. It is especially not a substitute for independently enforcing a no-write sandbox. The demonstration uses its own unprivileged process to generate and collect events; the observer is not a separately trusted runner service.

No actual 20-job annual preflight+18 cell+freeze observer evidence, protected data, publisher receipt or authenticated kernel security profile is provided. DEC-650 draft #820 real OS confinement and DEC-651 draft #821 / issue #779 exclusive server-side immutable one-shot dispatch remain BLOCKED. Green synthetic tests do not authorize annual run 385.

**Hard stops:** no merge/ready promotion, actual 385 dispatch/test/rerun/retry, protected annual artifact reads, main/refs/workflow/ruleset/permission/runner changes, broker or trading action.
