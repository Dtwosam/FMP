### EXP-20260914-001 — Session breakout baseline

- Date: 2026-09-14
- Status: PLANNED
- Hypothesis: After a completed pre-London range, a confirmed break during the early London session may exhibit enough short-horizon continuation on some V1 pair/timeframe combinations to overcome historical spread and adverse slippage under fixed-risk execution. No profitability is assumed.
- Code commit: merged-main workflow head SHA recorded by the experiment artifact; copied into the result record after execution.
- Data manifest/version: accepted Phase 2 processed manifests, schema `fmp-canonical-1m-v1`, from the immutable accepted EURUSD/GBPUSD/USDJPY full-history artifacts recorded in `docs/project-state.md`.
- Pair(s): EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY
- Timeframe(s): 5m, 15m, 1h
- Data range: accepted Phase 2 coverage 2015-01-01 through 2026-08-20 inclusive; this experiment runner is limited to development and validation.
- Train period: 2015-01-01 through 2020-12-31 inclusive
- Validation period: 2021-01-01 through 2023-12-31 inclusive
- Final-test touched?: NO
- Strategy/model: deterministic `session_breakout` baseline, `Europe/London`; range 00:00–08:00, breakout observation 08:00–12:00, exact mandatory flat timestamp 16:00 local; first qualifying breakout only.
- Features: midpoint OHLC only for range/signal analysis; Phase 3 historical BID/ASK execution remains the sole fill/PnL source of truth.
- Parameters/search space: `buffer_pips = {0, 2, 5}` × `target_range_multiple = {0.5, 1.0, 1.5}`; exactly 9 predeclared configurations per pair/timeframe and no post-result expansion under this experiment ID.
- Random seed (if relevant): not applicable; deterministic strategy and backtester.
- Spread/cost model: historical BID/ASK spread; zero commission; zero financing.
- Slippage model: 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 pips per fill, adverse on every execution side.
- Risk assumptions: 0.25% requested; 0.50% hard per-trade max; 1.00% simultaneous max; 1.50% UTC day-start realized-loss halt; accepted Phase 3 sizing/execution rules unchanged.
- Follow-up: Run the merged-main source-free development/validation matrix, preserve all configurations including losing and empty rows, independently inspect deterministic artifacts, then record the evidence-supported experiment outcome. The final test remains untouched.
