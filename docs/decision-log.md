# FMP Decision Log

Later approved decisions override older assumptions only when this log says so and affected source-of-truth files are updated in the same change.

Detailed DEC-001 through DEC-013 text is preserved at commit `0ff45220cd930839059afcfba631e1e120cb38aa`, `docs/decision-log.md`, and remains authoritative for historical Phase 1 rules.

## DEC-014 — Phase 1 frozen snapshot accepted

**Date:** 2026-09-13  
**Status:** APPROVED

Phase 1 is accepted for the frozen EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY BID/ASK snapshot covering 2015-01-01 through 2026-08-20 inclusive.

Evidence: 25,500 expected and present raw-backed manifests; zero missing/unexpected identities; zero inferred `not_found`; final cloud provenance run `34758527971` on `0ff45220cd930839059afcfba631e1e120cb38aa` reported zero invalid manifests/raw audits/checksum or size mismatches; cross-report acceptance was 55 passed, 0 failed. Frozen plan SHA-256 is `2328a5417e04dcda862bd93066243ebf95d480443e8d098d08c9e0e1f78b3be6`.

Consequences: Phase 1 PASS; Phase 2 unlocked; no further Phase 1 acquisition is required unless later integrity evidence demands it; DEC-008 remains unchanged.

## DEC-015 — Phase 2 exhaustive acceptance review

**Date:** 2026-09-14  
**Status:** APPROVED

`phase2-full-history` run `34782357048` on `158c1c121655867b7fb2886fe755585dfcd682ec` completed successfully on attempt 2. For each pair, acceptance proved exactly 8,500 verified reads, 140 months, 140 monthly partitions for each 1m/5m/15m/1h timeframe, row counts of 6,120,000 / 1,224,000 / 408,000 / 102,000, and a 561-artifact processed manifest.

Independent artifact inspection found zero digest, size, ledger-identity, or monthly-partition validation errors. All three quality reports have zero duplicates, missing BID/ASK rows, required nulls, missing open-market minutes, and suspicious gaps. Outlier telemetry is retained without silent mutation. Required canonical, quote-sanity, boundary/resampling, weekend-gap, DST, ledger, workflow-guard, and materialization tests were green.

USDJPY attempt 1 received one HTTP 401 from the read-only raw Edge Function; an isolated no-change rerun succeeded, so the failure did not reproduce as a deterministic data/materialization defect.

Checkpoint `fmp-v1-phase2-normalized-data` was created at verified acceptance commit `80e763c46fc365d48922fb37de1a70dfe188de70`.

Consequences: Phase 2 is formally PASS and closed at `fmp-v1-phase2-normalized-data`; Phase 3 remains unstarted; DEC-008 remains unchanged. Detailed evidence is in `docs/phase2-acceptance-evidence.md`.
