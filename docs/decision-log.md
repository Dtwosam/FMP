# FMP Decision Log

Later approved decisions override older assumptions only when this log says so and affected source-of-truth files are updated in the same change.

Detailed DEC-001 through DEC-013 text is preserved at commit `0ff45220cd930839059afcfba631e1e120cb38aa`, `docs/decision-log.md`, and remains authoritative for historical Phase 1 rules.

## DEC-014 — Phase 1 frozen snapshot accepted

**Date:** 2026-09-13  
**Status:** APPROVED

Phase 1 is accepted for the frozen EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY BID/ASK snapshot covering 2015-01-01 through 2026-08-20 inclusive.

Evidence: 25,500 expected and present raw-backed manifests; zero missing/unexpected identities; zero inferred `not_found`; final cloud provenance run `34758527971` on `0ff45220cd930839059afcfba631e1e120cb38aa` reported zero invalid manifests/raw audits/checksum or size mismatches; cross-report acceptance was 55 passed, 0 failed. Frozen plan SHA-256 is `2328a5417e04dcda862bd93066243ebf95d480443e8d098d08c9e0e1f78b3be6`.

Consequences: Phase 1 PASS; Phase 2 unlocked; no further Phase 1 acquisition is required unless later integrity evidence demands it; DEC-008 remains unchanged.

## DEC-015 — Phase 2 exhaustive acceptance review

**Date:** 2026-09-14  
**Status:** APPROVED

`phase2-full-history` run `34782357048` on `158c1c121655867b7fb2886fe755585dfcd682ec` completed successfully on attempt 2. For each pair, acceptance proved exactly 8,500 verified reads, 140 months, 140 monthly partitions for each 1m/5m/15m/1h timeframe, row counts of 6,120,000 / 1,224,000 / 408,000 / 102,000, and a 561-artifact processed manifest.

Independent artifact inspection found zero digest, size, ledger-identity, or monthly-partition validation errors. All three quality reports have zero duplicates, missing BID/ASK rows, required nulls, missing open-market minutes, and suspicious gaps. Outlier telemetry is retained without silent mutation. Required canonical, quote-sanity, boundary/resampling, weekend-gap, DST, ledger, workflow-guard, and materialization tests were green.

USDJPY attempt 1 received one HTTP 401 from the read-only raw Edge Function; an isolated no-change rerun succeeded, so the failure did not reproduce as a deterministic data/materialization defect.

Checkpoint `fmp-v1-phase2-normalized-data` was created at verified acceptance commit `80e763c46fc365d48922fb37de1a70dfe188de70`.

Consequences: Phase 2 is formally PASS and closed at `fmp-v1-phase2-normalized-data`; Phase 3 remains unstarted; DEC-008 remains unchanged. Detailed evidence is in `docs/phase2-acceptance-evidence.md`.

## DEC-016 — Phase 3 backtester semantics

**Date:** 2026-09-14  
**Status:** APPROVED

Phase 3 uses a deterministic, broker-independent backtesting engine over the accepted canonical bid/ask data. Its risk and execution semantics are frozen as follows:

- Daily loss control uses UTC day-start **realized risk equity** as its basis.
- Realized daily PnL at or below `-1.50%` of that basis blocks new entries for the remainder of the UTC date.
- Existing positions are not force-closed solely because the daily-loss halt becomes active.
- Existing-position exits are processed before new entries at the same timestamp, so released risk is immediately available to later same-timestamp decisions.
- Simultaneous eligible decisions are ordered deterministically by `decision_id`.
- LONG entries execute from ASK and LONG exits from BID; SHORT entries execute from BID and SHORT exits from ASK.
- If both stop and target are reachable within a bar and the path is unresolved, STOP wins and the trade is marked intrabar-ambiguous.
- An adverse stop gap uses the worse executable-side open; a favorable target gap receives no price improvement beyond the declared target.
- End-of-data closure uses the final executable close side: BID close for LONG and ASK close for SHORT.
- Slippage is adverse and accounted exactly once; commission and financing are explicit cost components.
- USDJPY stop sizing converts quote-currency loss at the stop price, while realized USDJPY PnL converts at the executable exit price.
- Backtest artifacts are deterministic and contain no runtime clock, hostname, UUID, or process metadata.

These semantics grant no real-money permission and do not alter DEC-008. Phase 4 remains unstarted.

## DEC-017 — Phase 3 deterministic acceptance review

**Date:** 2026-09-14  
**Status:** APPROVED

Phase 3's acceptance gate is approved from merged-main evidence.

Implementation PR #78 merged as `96ca80b3baae4de511b5b14eb6c2f9d4d723645b`. The source-free acceptance-runner PR #79 merged as `f7d98676d40f9af67f2d6f6cde36b3a465f68741`. Exact merged-main test run `34838682046` completed successfully with 300 tests, workflow YAML validation, and package compile all passing.

Formal acceptance workflow run `34838682032` on exact main SHA `f7d98676d40f9af67f2d6f6cde36b3a465f68741` completed successfully and produced artifact `10344943075`, whose GitHub SHA-256 and independently recomputed ZIP SHA-256 both equal `357152cef5118163f06f9d6166e7e02cdd7ed556a3de1c5723a6a6079bd6c4f0`.

Independent inspection verified all five scripted scenarios, all primary/repeat artifact bytes, every manifest-listed SHA/size, run identities, realized-equity checkpoints, hand-calculated PnL/costs, rejection codes, and independently recomputed metrics with zero validation errors. The reviewed scenarios prove LONG/SHORT executable-side pricing, nonzero slippage/commission accounting, conservative same-bar ambiguity, simultaneous-risk rejection, daily realized-loss halt, and next-UTC-day reset. The merged-main suite additionally proves USDJPY sizing/PnL conversion, timing/no-lookahead, gap handling, exact risk boundaries, exit-before-entry risk release, stable decision ordering, EOD side selection, and deterministic serialization.

The evidence merge SHA triggered exactly `tests` and `phase3-acceptance`; no Phase 1 acquisition-capable workflow triggered for that SHA. No source acquisition, raw mutation, Supabase write, broker/live path, Phase 4 strategy code, or real-money permission was introduced.

Checkpoint branch `fmp-v1-phase3-backtester` was created after the acceptance-closure merge and independently verified to resolve exactly to commit `7685ba73f18457d5d3945f2fea21ceba3de81cf1`, which contains `docs/phase3-acceptance-evidence.md` and this acceptance decision.

Consequences: Phase 3 is formally PASS and closed at `fmp-v1-phase3-backtester`. Phase 4 remains unstarted and DEC-008 remains unchanged. Detailed evidence is in `docs/phase3-acceptance-evidence.md`.

## DEC-018 — Phase 4 baseline research protocol

**Date:** 2026-09-14  
**Status:** APPROVED

Phase 4 begins with the session-breakout family under a frozen chronological, anti-leakage, source-free research protocol. No profitability is assumed; failed and empty configurations remain evidence.

- Development: 2015-01-01 through 2020-12-31 inclusive.
- Validation: 2021-01-01 through 2023-12-31 inclusive.
- Final untouched test: 2024-01-01 through 2026-08-20 inclusive.
- The final-test data is unavailable from the normal development/validation runner. Final access requires a separate explicit promotion step after candidate selection is materially complete.
- Phase 2 derived bars are left-labelled. For a timeframe of width `W`, the observation label `T` identifies the start of the closed bar; true signal-known time is `T + W`. The Phase 3 decision timestamp remains `T`, while the earliest executable timestamp is `T + W`, preserving the accepted next-bar execution contract without implying same-bar knowledge.
- The session-breakout grid is exactly `(0, 0.5), (0, 1.0), (0, 1.5), (2, 0.5), (2, 1.0), (2, 1.5), (5, 0.5), (5, 1.0), (5, 1.5)`, representing buffer pips and target range multiples.
- Predeclared adverse slippage is 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 pips per fill.
- The initial mandatory-intraday-flat family uses zero commission and zero financing; historical BID/ASK spread remains in execution prices.
- Phase 3 risk settings are unchanged: requested risk/trade: 0.25%; hard max risk/trade: 0.50%; maximum simultaneous open risk: 1.00%; daily realized-loss halt: 1.50% of UTC day-start realized risk equity.

Consequences: Phase 4 is ACTIVE for sequential baseline research. Development and validation may run only under the predeclared protocol; the final test remains untouched. Phase 5 remains unstarted, real-money trading remains locked, and DEC-008 remains unchanged.
