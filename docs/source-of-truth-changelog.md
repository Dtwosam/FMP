## 2026-09-22 — Phase 8A portfolio-research pivot

- Approved DEC-039 and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-phase8a-portfolio-research-redesign.md`.
- Stopped EXP-20260922-011 before campaign registration; preserved its successful connector qualification and historical-reference artifacts as non-scored evidence.
- Split Phase 8 into 8A multi-pair/multi-strategy portfolio research and 8B multi-strategy live shadow.
- Reaffirmed the V1 universe as exactly EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY and required reuse of all accepted Dukascopy histories.
- Added immutable strategy-version and champion/challenger architecture with no hot-swapping into an active campaign.
- Clarified that 2024-01-01 through 2026-08-20 is no longer untouched for new post-Phase-7 strategies because Phase 7 already opened it.
- Added portfolio-level reporting, correlated USD exposure analysis, daily-return distribution reporting, and explicit high-return aspiration measurement without making 10% daily a guaranteed pass rule.
- Kept Phase 9 demo, broker mutation, live orders, and real-money execution locked.
